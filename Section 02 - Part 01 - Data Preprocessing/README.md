# Part 01 - Data Preprocessing
<hr>

Welcome to Part 01 on Data Preprocessing!
<hr>

We will start by learning and doing Data Preprocessing in Python (next section), and then in R (section after Python). I remind that it is not necessary to master the two languages. We just made this course in both Python and R so that everyone can work on its favourite programming language.

So feel free to pick the section you want (Python or R), and then move on to Part 2 - Regression.

Excited to begin with you the Machine Learning journey!

# Data Preprocessing
* Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data to make it suitable for analysis or machine learning tasks.
* In the below notebook, data preprocessing steps include handling missing data using SimpleImputer and scaling numerical features using StandardScaler.
