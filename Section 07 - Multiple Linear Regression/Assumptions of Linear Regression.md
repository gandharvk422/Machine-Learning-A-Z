# Assumptions of Linear Regression

## 1. Linearity
* Linear relationship between `y` and each `X`.

## 2. Homoscedasticity
* Equal variance

## 3. Multivariate Normality
* Normality of error distribution

## 4. Independence
* of observations. Includes **"no autocorrelation"**.

## 5. Lack of Multicollinearity
* Predictors are not correlated with each other

## 6. The Outlier Check
* This is not an assumption, but an "extra".
